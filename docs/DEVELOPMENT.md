# Development & handoff

## Shared workflow

- Canonical repository: https://github.com/jli-software/utterform
- Work directly on `main`. Pull before starting; commit and push each completed, validated change immediately. Never force-push over another contributor's work.
- Development is shared across machines and coding assistants. Keep architecture, decisions, release notes, and the current handoff in this repository, not only in chat history.
- Keep credentials, recordings, local transcript history, dependencies, and machine-specific configuration out of Git.
- GitHub Actions builds the downloadable binaries. Releases must include platform assets, not just source archives.

## 0.2.0 Beta scope

- Remove native window decorations on Omarchy only; preserve other platforms' window controls.
- Subtle violet/blue, large-area, microphone-responsive recording motion, respecting reduced-motion preferences.
- Short start/stop sounds; styled action and file-format menus.
- Persistent, locally titled recent texts, a compact history selector, and copy-again button/shortcut.
- Verify microphone capture continues across focus changes and when the window is hidden.
- Publish unsigned Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries through Actions.
- No automatic Omarchy theme switching in this iteration. Global recording shortcuts remain separate from background microphone capture.

## Initial audit

The app uses Svelte 5/TypeScript and Tauri 2/Rust, with CPAL microphone capture. Focus changes do not stop capture, but the current close-to-tray handler explicitly cancels it. The frontend currently discards its last text when starting another recording and keeps no persistent history. Release automation currently publishes Linux packages only.

## Implemented for 0.2.0

History, themed menus, copy-again controls, responsive ambient motion, optional native cues, Omarchy decorations, and background/close-to-tray capture are implemented. Local checks pass: Svelte/TypeScript, 9 component/unit tests, 16 Rust tests, Clippy, and production-bundle browser tests. Browser screenshots have been inspected in light/dark themes, at 920×720 and 720×620, including reduced motion and menu overlays. Browser tests use synthetic IPC, never the user's microphone, credentials, or clipboard.

Browser validation: `npx playwright install chromium`, then `npm run test:e2e`. For an existing local Chromium installation use `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/chromium npm run test:e2e`. Visual artifacts are written below ignored `test-results/`.

On the initial Linux development machine CMake was missing. An official, SHA-256-verified portable CMake was extracted into ignored `.tools/cmake-4.4.3-linux-x86_64`; prepend its `bin` directory to PATH for native builds. No system configuration was changed.

Remaining before release: version/release documentation, cross-platform binary publishing, and verification of the GitHub Actions run. Native interactive microphone/speaker and macOS/Windows desktop tests must be distinguished from mocked browser tests and cross-platform compilation.
