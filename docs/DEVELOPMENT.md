# Development & handoff

## Shared workflow

- Canonical repository: https://github.com/jli-software/utterform
- Work directly on `main`. Pull before starting; commit and push each completed, validated change immediately. Never force-push over another contributor's work.
- Development is shared across machines and coding assistants. Keep architecture, decisions, release notes, and the current handoff in this repository, not only in chat history.
- Keep credentials, recordings, local transcript history, dependencies, and machine-specific configuration out of Git.
- GitHub Actions builds the downloadable binaries. Releases must include platform assets, not just source archives.

## 0.2.0 Beta scope

- Remove native window decorations on Omarchy only; preserve other platforms' window controls.
- Subtle violet/blue, large-area, microphone-responsive recording motion, respecting reduced-motion preferences.
- Short start/stop sounds; styled action and file-format menus.
- Persistent, locally titled recent texts, a compact history selector, and copy-again button/shortcut.
- Verify microphone capture continues across focus changes and when the window is hidden.
- Publish unsigned Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries through Actions.
- No automatic Omarchy theme switching in this iteration. Global recording shortcuts remain separate from background microphone capture.

## Initial audit

The app uses Svelte 5/TypeScript and Tauri 2/Rust, with CPAL microphone capture. Focus changes do not stop capture, but the current close-to-tray handler explicitly cancels it. The frontend currently discards its last text when starting another recording and keeps no persistent history. Release automation currently publishes Linux packages only.

Frontend baseline: `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` pass. See README for the full native validation commands.
